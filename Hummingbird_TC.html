            <li> <em> The ruby-throated hummingbird (Archilochus colubris) is a species of hummingbird that generally migrates to Canada and other parts of Eastern North America for the summer to breed. </em></li>
            <br>
            <li> <strong> Scientific Name: </strong> Archilochus colubris </li>
            <li> <strong> Length: </strong> 11 centimeters </li>
            <li> <strong> Lifespan: </strong> 7 years 1 month</li>
            <li> <strong> Habitat: </strong> Tropical coral reefs </li>
            <br>
            <li>Ruby-throated hummingbirds are solitary. Adults of this species are not social, other than during courtship (which lasts a few minutes); 
                the female also cares for her offspring. Both males and females of any age are aggressive toward other hummingbirds. They may defend territories, 
                such as a feeding territory, attacking and chasing other hummingbirds that enter.</li>
